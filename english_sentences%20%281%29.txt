Under the Tatoeba guidelines, it is recommended that members only add sentences in their native language and/or translate from a language they can understand into their native language. The reason for this is that it is much easier to form natural-sounding sentences in one's native language. When we write in a language other than our native language, it is very easy to produce sentences that sound strange. Please make sure you only translate the sentence if you are sure you know what it means.

But you're not there.
But you've never told me about this!
But you know, it would be sad to collect all these sentences, and keep them for ourselves. Because there's so much you can do with them. Which is why Tatoeba is open. Our source code is open. Our data is open.
But you have kids.
But why?
But where do we get those sentences? And how do we translate them?
But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you.
But this is not true.
